**Thanks for taking a look!** We are aware that the session after the banquet+jam, last day, may be not easy to handle.

I've been very busy writing my PhD thesis I couldn't clean and document the code, sorry about that!
Code, together with notebooks to explore the individual components of the approach and recent improvement we've been workin on, will be up soon.

The latent diffusion frmaework in particular can be explored in [weAreMusicAI/dmx-diffusion](https://github.com/weAreMusicAI/dmx-diffusion).

Please contact us at genis.plaja@upf.edu for particular questions about our work.
